                    <h2>Game Development</h2>
                    <p>Video game developer is a broad term that can refer to any individual who creates video games for a living. 
                    If you are interested in gaining such a position, your job will most likely be to design, develop and 
                    test the software used in video games. However, you will probably work with a team of video game programmers and 
                    designers who are each trained to develop a certain aspect of a game. 
                    It is up to you to determine your specific role within such a team. 
                    For example, you might choose to become an audio system developer, a coding programmer, a visual artist, 
                    a game producer or a game designer. Each of these different positions can BE correctly labeled as 
                    a video game developer, although each has different specific job duties. 
                    You should determine where your skills and interests lie before you choose a specific role within 
                    the video game development field.</p>

                    <h2>Video Game Design</h2>
                    <p>Game design refers to the conceptual side of game development. 
                    It is essentially a collection of decisions about what the game should be and how it should work. 
                    That includes its gameplay, characters, storylines, locations, UI, and so on. 
                    Game design principles can vary significantly depending on the game genre.
                    For instance, role-playing games (RPGs) center around immersive storytelling and character development. 
                    Game designers in this genre focus on creating vast, detailed worlds with engaging narratives. 
                    On the other hand, if you're designing a hybrid-casual mobile game, 
                    you need to strike a balance between accessibility and depth, combining elements of casual gameplay 
                    with more complex mechanics. Each genre demands a unique approach, ensuring 
                    the game design aligns with the player's expectations and experience.</p>

                    <h2>Programming</h2>
                    <p>Game programmer is a general term applied to the computer engineers that work on computer games. 
                    Usually trained in the basic languages of computer programming, programmers make a game come to life. 
                    They may specialize in areas of coding such as graphics, AI, sound, scripting, user interface, network, tools, 
                    porting, etc. A strong knowledge of coding and the various platforms is vital to becoming a Game Programmer. 
                    They are a key part of the development team taking technical resources throughout the production process, 
                    ensuring that at the end of the process the game functions effectively.</p>
